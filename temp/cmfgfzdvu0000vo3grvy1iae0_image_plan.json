Inside the node, depict a summation symbol (\n\n) combining weighted inputs, followed by an activation function (f). An arrow leaving the node represents the single output. Emphasize the flow from input through processing to output.",

      "description": "A diagram showing a multi-layered deep neural network. The input layer receives a simple object image (e.g., a face outline). The first hidden layer extracts basic features (e.g., edges, simple shapes). Subsequent hidden layers combine these to recognize more complex patterns (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The output layer identifies the complete object (e.g., 'face'). Use arrows to show data flow and increasing abstraction of features across layers.",
