Generate a conversation between Stewie and Peter about the topic "{topic}". The conversation should be approximately 10-15 dialogue exchanges (5-7 per character) suitable for an Instagram reel audience.

Each dialogue line must be 280 characters or less.

The response must be a valid JSON object with this structure:
- conversation: array of dialogue objects
- topic: string

Each dialogue object must have:
- character: either "Stewie" or "Peter"
- dialogue: the text they speak (max 280 characters)

**Dialogue Length Requirement:** Generate exactly 10-15 dialogue exchanges (5-7 per character).

**Important Rules:**
